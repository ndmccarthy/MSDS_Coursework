Working with real data is always our ultimate end goal, so we will try to use as many real datasets in this course as possible. However, applying models to simulated data can be very instructive: such applications help us understand how models work in ideal settings, how robust they are to changes in modeling assumptions, and a whole host of other contexts.\n",
